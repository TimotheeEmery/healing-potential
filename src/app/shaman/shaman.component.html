        <h5>Welcome to the healing potential app for shamans</h5>
        <h6>What is it?</h6>
        <p>
          Have you ever compare two items and wondered for a moment which one
          would benefit the most your healing abilities? If your answer is yes,
          you've come to the right place! The healing potential app is made to
          compute how much HP you can heal through a whole fight by informing
          the key factors. By varying those factors you can easily see the
          effect on the healing potential and assess which ones matter the most.
          <br />
        </p>
        <h6>How to use it?</h6>
        <p>
          Simply inform the variables and modifiers below before clicking on the
          "Compute score" button, The result will be shown below it. The healing
          potential represents the number of hp you can heal during the whole
          fight. The detailed results shows which ranks will be used, and the
          value of each stats, which is how much healing potential it would add
          by having 1 more of that stat.
