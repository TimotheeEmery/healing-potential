          <h5>Welcome to the healing potential app for shamans</h5>
          <h6>What is it?</h6>
          <p>
            Have you ever compare two items and wondered for a moment which one
            would benefit the most your healing abilities? If your answer is
            yes, you've come to the right place! The healing potential app is
            made to compute how much HP you can heal through a whole fight by
            informing the key factors. By varying those factors you can easily
            see the effect on the healing potential and assess which ones matter
            the most.
            <br />
          </p>
          <h6>How to use it?</h6>
          <p>
            Simply inform the variables and modifiers below before clicking on
            the "Compute score" button, The result will be shown below it. The
            healing potential represents the number of hp you can heal during
            the whole fight. The detailed results shows which ranks will be
            used, and the value of each stats, which is how much healing
            potential it would add by having 1 more of that stat.
          </p>
